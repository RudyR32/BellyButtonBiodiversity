# BellyButtonBiodiversity
## Summary
Rosa has set out with the task of finding the perfect strain of bacteria to ultimately help her create a indistinguishable beef alternative.  It is her thought that this strain could come from a human belly button.  Data has been collected from a large group of individuals from all over the country to help identify this strain.  Together we have compiled a interactive webpage(Dashboard) to display all of the different strains of bacteria that exist in each individuals belly button.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard contains the following.<br/>
-  Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.<br/>
-  Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.<br/>
-  Complete the demographic information panel, if you have not done so.<br/>
