# BellyButtonBiodiversity
Rosa has set out with the task of finding the perfect strain of bacteria to ultimately help her create a indistinguishable beef alternative.  It is her thought that this strain could come from a human belly button.  Data has been collected from a large group of individuals from all over the country to help identify this strain.  Together we have compiled a interactive webpage to display all of the different strains of bacteria that exist in each individuals belly button.
