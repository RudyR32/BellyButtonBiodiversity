# BellyButtonBiodiversity
## Summary
Rosa has set out with the task of finding the perfect strain of bacteria to ultimately help her create a indistinguishable beef alternative.  It is her thought that this strain could come from a human belly button.  Data has been collected from a large group of anonymous individuals from all over the country to help identify this strain.  Together we have compiled a interactive webpage(Dashboard) to display all of the different strains of bacteria that exist in each individuals belly button.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard contains the following:<br/>
-  A bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. JavaScript was used to select only the most populous species.<br/>
-  A bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.<br/>
-  A Complete demographic information panel of the individual whose data you are viewing.<br/>
